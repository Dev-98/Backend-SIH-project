1. Can ask them to do some activites which we can present as a pop-up if they skip it 
that means they are not interested in that type of activity whilst we can add score based
on activity given if they did it

2. Right now given career field is broad we can let them do another session based on the 
recommended career so they can understand more about it 

3. If questions feels overwhelming we can ask them " Still feeling confused, wanna ask a 
professional what to do " then we can connect him to a counselor - which leads to another 
type of business idea as counsellor will come with a premium plan after rating stuff and 
all we can charge some sort of portal fees from what they earn (something like that ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤ ).
